    async def analyze_compliance_scenario(self, scenario):
        """Legally defensible compliance analysis"""
        
        # Step 1: DSP cultural prediction with cost optimization
        dsp_prediction = await self.dsp_engine.analyze_scenario(scenario)
        
        # Step 2: HallBayes hallucination risk assessment  
        hallucination_risk = self.hallucination_detector.calculate_risk(
            scenario=scenario,
            prediction=dsp_prediction
        )
        
        # Step 3: Abstention decision with mathematical guarantee
        if hallucination_risk > self.abstention_threshold:
            return self.generate_abstention_response(
                scenario=scenario,
                risk_level=hallucination_risk,
                confidence_required=self.abstention_threshold
            )
        
        # Step 4: Certified compliance recommendation
        certified_result = self.generate_certified_recommendation(
            dsp_prediction=dsp_prediction,
            hallucination_risk=hallucination_risk,
            legal_framework="Ley_27401"
        )
        
        # Step 5: Audit trail for legal defensibility
        self.audit_logger.log_certified_decision(
            scenario=scenario,
            result=certified_result,
            mathematical_proof=hallucination_risk,
            regulatory_framework="Argentina"
